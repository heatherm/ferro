#Ferro

##Processing
With processing and Minim, I laod mp3s and parse the
sounds to send via Serial to Arduino:

ferro_java/ferro_java.pde

##Arduino
I used an Uno to Control a continuous rotation servo
with incoming direction cues from Processing:

ferro_servo_java/ferro_servo_java.ino

##Other Materials

### Worked
- [x]  4 oz ferro fluid
- [x]  2 magnets about 1.5 inches in diameter
- [x]  1k and 220k resistors
- [x]  breadboard
- [x]  jumper wires
- [x]  isopropyl 70%
- [x]  scalpels & blades
- [x]  steel ruler
- [x]  silicon stretch top for ferrofluid dish
- [x]  hot glue & sticks
- [x]  arcade spst momentary buttons
- [x]  2 5k potentiometers & dials
- [x]  Headphones
- [x]  continuous servo 360

### Tried, did not work out
- [x]  rainx as a hydrophylic to prevent ferrofluid stains
- [x]  isopropyl 91% alcohol
- [x]  12V 700N electromagnet
- [x]  aluminum plate (would have used as heat sink for large emagnets)
- [x]  8266 board for wifi communication
- [x]  3.3v voltage regulators (for logic level power on the 8266)
- [x]  25N 9V electromagnet (too weak to pull fluid)
- [x]  nema17 stepper motor with detachable wires 12v
- [x]  a4988 stepper motor driver
- [x]  sg90 9g mini servo (too loud)

### More to come. Feel free to send questions.
